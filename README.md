Secure Quest

What's this?
Next-gen recruiting platform that turns Web3 security hiring into gamified "quests".
Companies post real multi-stage challenges, and hackers and coders prove their skills by breaching simulated vulnerabilities or solving riddles step-by-step — unlocking prizes and guaranteed interviews as they advance.
It’s where talent meets real-world proof of skill — no résumés, just results.
