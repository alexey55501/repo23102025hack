## ✨ What is SecureQuest?

Traditional hiring is broken. It depends on résumés, referrals, and luck — not skill.

SecureQuest flips the process:
- Companies publish **real multi-stage security challenges**
- Hackers & developers solve them level by level
- Completion unlocks **prizes + guaranteed interviews**

Think:  
**Google’s famous “hidden recruiting puzzles” × Telegram Quest mechanics × On-chain proof-of-skill**

No gatekeepers  
No CV filters  
No “we’ll keep you in our system” emails  

Just **skill → proof → rewards**

## 🧠 How It Works

| Role | What they do |
|------|--------------|
| ✅ Companies | Create quests with real secure code / bug logic / puzzles |
| ✅ Hackers & developers | Play through challenges by exploiting bugs or solving riddles |
| ✅ Platform | Tracks progress, stores achievements on-chain, unlocks interview rewards |

## 🔥 Why SecureQuest?

✔ Removes bias — skill is the only metric  
✔ No résumé screening — proof of skill happens automatically  
✔ On-chain achievements belong to the developer  
✔ Companies get verified, pre-qualified talent  

> You don’t apply for a job — you **earn it by completing the quest.**
